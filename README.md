This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAbhU_iBF0Zn-cRmjA5jbdedPcg_BYK10IackfSwlnU/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.


# Project Reflection

**Question:** Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project.  
Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

One technical concept I developed greater mastery over in this project was organizing and styling form elements using **containers** and **class names**. My mental model is **thinking in systems** by treating the form as a collection of smaller parts that can be arranged and styled independently. I applied this by placing each input and the message box inside a container and giving each a class name, which made the layout consistent, easy to manage, and visually appealing.

**Question:** Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible.

One project requirement I found challenging was creating a consistent grid of project cards for my project section. The main challenge was making sure that all the images inside the card appeared consistent, since some were rectangular and others were square.

To fix this, I placed each image inside a clickable container (a link) and adjusted the image so it would stretch to fill the space evenly. This ensured all the images looked consistent and aligned nicely across the grid.

**Question:** How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

I leveraged AI to better understand certain concepts and CSS properties, such as `transform`, that were not covered in this class. AI also helped me troubleshoot an issue with the navbar appearing transparent over the project section while working on the CSS."
